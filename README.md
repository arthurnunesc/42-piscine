# 42

## subjects

- Every document, resource, norm or video given by 42 for each and every project will be on this directory on its specific folder(eg. c00, c01, rush00, etc).

## finished

- This folder will contain every try of each project I set as finished. The naming convention will be "<project*name>*<try_number>"(eg. c00_0 for the first try of the first C project). If any project needs any change to be turned in again, the folder of the last try of the project shall be cloned into the "current" folder and stay there until it is turned in again.

## leftovers

- Houses project files which weren't asked to be turned in but were needed to be created to finish projects(eg. main.c files).
